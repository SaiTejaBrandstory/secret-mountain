                <p>
                    Google Cloud today announced a collaboration with Secret  Mountain, the metahuman digital avatar band conceived by Oscar and Grammy-winning  composer A.R. Rahman. This collaboration will leverage Google Cloud's infrastructure and  advanced AI models to power a new generation of entertainment, creating a groundbreaking  media experience for a global audience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret Mountain is an entertainment project that fuses AI-powered ‘synthetic avatars’ with  genre-bending music and immersive storytelling. Backed by the creative vision of A.R. Rahman,  the project aims to redefine how audiences engage with digital artists while uniting global  cultures and pushing the boundaries of immersive entertainment. The diverse lineup of six  digital avatars including Cara (an Irish singer-songwriter), Zen Tam (a Tamil rapper), and  Blessing (an African percussionist and vocalist reflects the project's core commitment to  cultural diversity.               
                </p>

                <p>
                    The initiative aims to build a global music movement by focusing on strategic partnerships,  fan-centric community building, and worldwide collaborations. This ambition is made possible  by the project's cutting-edge technological architecture, which creates hyper-realistic avatars  that can look, move, and emote like real humans in real-time.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Google Cloud’s infrastructure and Google’s AI models underpin the Secret Mountain universe,  generating awe-inspiring visuals and dynamic interactions. This includes Veo 3 for avatar  embodiment and video generation, and Imagen and Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (Nano Banana) for  high-quality visual and image creation. The avatars' intelligence and conversational abilities will  be brought to life by Gemini 2.5 Pro and trained on custom datasets, serving as the multimodal  "conversational brain" that will enable real-time fan engagement at a massive scale.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    “Secret Mountain is about reimagining how music, storytelling, and technology come together to  create new experiences for audiences all over the world. Behind each character is a team of  producers, singers, creators, dancers, choreographers, actors, and mentors, in a celebration of  passionate human talent, at its core, each dedicated to their art. It is exciting and empowering  to have a tech giant like Google as our partner, with the full power of their world-class AI and  creative technologies behind us. AI is a catalyst for innovation, enabling artists to create,  experiment, and perform in ways that were once impossible. Together, we are building a bold  new world of entertainment where human artistry and AI technology stand side by side to  inspire audiences everywhere,” said A.R. Rahman, founder and creative force behind Secret  Mountain.

                <p>
                    Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud said, "India is showing how to fuse world-class artistry with  production-ready AI, and this collaboration with A.R. Rahman is setting a new bar for the  industry. By building on Google Cloud's infrastructure and advanced AI models, Secret Mountain  is not only delivering an awe-inspiring interactive digital experience, but also ensuring that  security, scalability, and governance are built-in."
